  PBS Mom Server Configuration.  This is an example of how to use the
  "eval" tag.  In this case a small Python script is used to build the
  shell code that builds the config file in the post section of the
  kickstart file.

  Revision 1.12  2006/10/02 19:43:35  royd
  backed out clienthost setting in mom_config. It was just a test anyway.

  Revision 1.11  2006/09/08 22:02:17  royd
  added clienthost back in. Why it is needed beats me.

  Revision 1.10  2006/01/12 08:07:14  royd
  Changed clienthost to pbsserver in mom config due to changes in
  torque 2.0.0p5.
  Also deleted the extra clienthost lines for localhost to avoid the mom
  polling itself.  torque now supports multiple pbs_servers, maybe something
  to look into one day?

  Revision 1.9  2005/03/04 01:40:11  mjk
  massive graph cleanup

  Revision 1.8  2004/10/22 11:57:52  royd
  Further mods to accomodate the change in network setup in 3.3.0.
  config for mom needs to have the local domain in clienthost and
  public domain for usecp.  YIKES!!!

  Revision 1.7  2004/10/22 08:00:02  royd
  Changed mom config to accept a frontend on the local domain.

  Revision 1.6  2004/01/27 20:07:48  royd
  Changes to use torque instead of storm.

  Revision 1.5  2004/01/19 14:14:38  royd
  Added code to start the mom on the compute nodes.

  Revision 1.4  2004/01/16 09:35:18  royd
  The frontends name needs to be the first one in moms config file or else it wont talk to the server, this wasn't needed for OpenPBS, probably a bug in SPBS.
